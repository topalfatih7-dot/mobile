# Yeni Form Expo Implementation

## Preconditions

1. Read `docs/mobile/IMPLEMENTATION-LOCK.md` — obey fully.
2. Read `yeniform-mobile-router` routing result.
3. Read relevant `docs/mobile/screens/**` + `flows/**` + `contracts/**`.
4. **Web parity (zorunlu):** open matching files under `/Users/mac/Desktop/Serenova-F-t/Adsız` (`src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/services`) and mirror layout + data/actions — no invented fields.
5. If screen is marked IMPLEMENTATION LOCK, treat every string/JSON/gate as mandatory.
6. If spec missing or GAP → **stop**. Do not invent UI, endpoints, or fields. Use gap protocol in IMPLEMENTATION-LOCK.md.

## Stack defaults

- Expo (current stable SDK) + Expo Router (file-based)
- Supabase JS client with SecureStore session
- UI: StyleSheet / theme from `docs/mobile/02-design-system.md`
- Payments: web Stripe CTA (`yeniform-membership-payments`) — no in-app IAP
- Video call: Daily React Native (`yeniform-chat-realtime-video`)
- Media: `yeniform-media-exercises`

## Folder suggestion

```
mobile/   # or apps/mobile
  app/           # Expo Router
  src/theme/
  src/services/  # supabase, api
  src/features/
```

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Role gates match `03-navigation.md` (member/staff/admin)
- [ ] ProfileCompletionGate parity (`hasRegisteredMember`)
- [ ] Entitlement checks before gated features
- [ ] API calls use Bearer session; same paths as `contracts/`
- [ ] Empty/loading/error states from screen spec
- [ ] Turkish copy
