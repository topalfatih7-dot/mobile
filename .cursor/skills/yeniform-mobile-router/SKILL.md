# Yeni Form Mobile Router

## When activated

1. Classify the user request into one or more buckets below.
2. **Read** the matching skill’s `SKILL.md` (and `reference.md` if needed) before editing.
3. Prefer `docs/mobile/` as source of truth for mobile behavior; **always** verify against the web project at `/Users/mac/Desktop/Serenova-F-t/Adsız` (`src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/services`, `src/context`, `api/`) — web parity is mandatory.
4. For Supabase schema/RLS, also read `.agents/skills/supabase/SKILL.md`.

## Routing table

| Signal in request | Read next |
|-------------------|-----------|
| spesifikasyon, handoff, docs/mobile yaz/güncelle | `yeniform-mobile-spec` |
| Expo kod, ekran implement, Router, RN UI | `yeniform-expo-app` |
| paket, üyelik, entitlement, Stripe, ödeme, paywall | `yeniform-membership-payments` |
| login, kayıt, onboarding, OAuth, şifre, gate | `yeniform-auth-onboarding` |
| mesaj, chat, realtime, Daily, video call, push | `yeniform-chat-realtime-video` |
| sağlık testi, takvim, program, öğün, kalori | `yeniform-health-programs` |
| staff, koç, diyetisyen, admin, premium, başvuru | `yeniform-staff-admin` |
| kütüphane, signed URL, thumbnail, video_pending | `yeniform-media-exercises` |

Multiple signals → read router targets **in parallel**, then execute in dependency order (auth/entitlement before feature UI).

## Hard rules

- First read `docs/mobile/IMPLEMENTATION-LOCK.md` on any mobile task.
- Do not invent product rules; use `docs/mobile/` + web code at `/Users/mac/Desktop/Serenova-F-t/Adsız`.
- Before coding a screen: open the matching web `src/pages/**` (and its components/services) and mirror layout + data/actions — no invented fields.
- Payments: web Stripe only; mobile CTA → login’li `/plans` (`/auth/callback?next=/plans&src=mobile`); entitlement in Supabase `members`. No RevenueCat/IAP.
- Panels: member + staff native. **Admin web-only** (`/(auth)/admin-web`).
- Turkish UI copy parity with web — locked strings win over “better” copy.
- If conflict between imagination and LOCK file → LOCK wins; if conflict between LOCK and live web → ask user / GAP protocol.
